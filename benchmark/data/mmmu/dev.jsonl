{"id": "dev_Math_2", "question": "For the function f(x) = 8x^3 - 2x^2 - 7x + 3, perform two iterations of the dichotomous search scheme for locating the minimum in [0, 1]. In the interval [0, 1], apply the three-point equal-interval search scheme and compare the results with the above solution. Applying the quadratic interpolation technique, find λ^ from (1) and compare the result with that of dichotomous search: λ^ = (1/2) [{g(a)(c^2 - b^2) + g(b)(a^2 - c^2) + g(c)(b^2 - a^2)} / {g(a)(c - b) + g(b)(a - c) + g(c)(b - a)}] (1) Choose ε = 0.1.\n<image 1>", "options": "['The dichotomous search yields a smaller interval containing $ x^* $ than the equal-interval search.', \"The value obtained from quadratic interpolation $ \\\\lambda' = 0.52 $ is an accurate estimate for $ \\\\lambda^* $.\", 'The equal-interval search required more function evaluations than the quadratic interpolation.', '$ f(x) $ has a minimum of 5 in the interval $ [-1, 1] $.']", "explanation": "One can analytically verify that in the interval [   1, 1], f(x) has a maximum of 5 at x = - 0.464 and a minimum of - 0.2 at x = 0.63. The graph of f(x) is shown in Fig. 1. Dichotomous Search: Set a^0 = 0, b^0 = 1. Then c^0 = 0.5, x1^0 = 0.45, and x2^0 = 0.55. By direct computation obtain f(0.45) = 0.52 and f(0.55) = - 0.124. Since f(x1^0) > f(x2^0), set a^1 = x1^0 = 0.45 and b^1 = b^0 = 1. Then c^1 = 0.725, x1^1 = 0.675, and x2^1 = 0.775. Again, by direct computation f (0.675) = - 0.17 and f(0.775) = 0.076. Since f(x2^1) > f(x1^1),  set a^2 = a^1 = 0.45 and b^2 = x2^1 = 0.775. Equal Interval Search: Since a^0 = 0 and b^0 = 1, choose x1^0 = 0.25, x2^0 = 0.5, and x3^0 = 0.75. By direct computation f(0.25) = 1.24, and f(0.5) = f(0.75) = 0. Thus either a^1 = 0.5 and b^1 = 1 or a^1 = 0.25 and b^1 = 0.75 can be set, and both these intervals contain x*. In this case b^1 - a^1 = 0.50, compared with b^1 - a^1 = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55 in dichotomous search. Further reduce the length of the interval containing x* by noting that f(x) is unimodal and f(0.5) = f(0.75) < f(0.25). Thus set a^1 = 0.5 and b1 = 0.75, which results in b^1 - a^1 = 0.25 rather than 0.5. However, in this case f(x) must be evaluated three times in the next iteration. Quadratic Interpolation: Note that g(0) = 3 and g(1) = 2, i.e., g(1) < g(0). Compute g(λ) for λ = 2 and obtain g(2) = 45. Since g(2) > g(1), set a = 0, b = 1, and c = 2. Then by (1): λ^ = (1/2)[{3(4 - 1) + 2(0 - 4) + 45(1 - 0)} / {3(2 - 1) + 2(0 - 2) + 45(1 - 0)}] = 0.52. It is known that g(λ) attains a minimum in [0, 1] at λ* = 0.63, and thus λ^ = 0.52 is a poor estimate of λ* although it does require only three function, evaluations. Most of the other interval search techniques will yield a better estimate of λ* with four function evaluations. However, this accuracy may not be needed in the initial stages of an optimization algorithm which uses a one-dimensional search in every iteration.", "image_2": null, "image_3": null, "image_4": null, "image_5": null, "image_6": null, "image_7": null, "img_type": "['Mathematical Notations']", "answer": "D", "topic_difficulty": "Easy", "question_type": "multiple-choice", "subfield": "Operation Research"}
